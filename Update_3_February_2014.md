# Time Series Data Visualization #

The User Interface now offers the 'Parameter' tab in the Temporal section.  Data that are of featureType timeSeries or timeSeriesProfile can be plotted on Parameter/Time axes.  A time range can be selected with the mouse to zoom into features of interest; that filter is applied to all of the other presentations of data helping discovery of correlated spatial/temporal measurements.

# Metadata #

The source(s) of the data in the current selection are now provided in the NetCDF tab of the Metadata section. There are 4 columns displayed in subsections organized by Platform name:

  1. The Name of the data set which is linked to the OPeNDAP Data Access form
  1. The Title extracted from the global metadata
  1. The Summary text extracted from the global metadata
  1. The Comment created when the data were loaded into the database along with the time loaded

For additional details on the data click on the link in the first column.

If the data have any quick look graphics that were registered when the data were loaded then they appear in a separate Quick look plots tab in the Metadata section. (As of February 2014 only Dorado data are loaded with quick look graphics.)

Below is a screen shot from the http://odss.mbari.org/canon/stoqs_september2013_o/query/ campaign where the Measured Parameter "chl" from two moorings has been selected for display as a time series plot. The original source links to the data are shown in the expanded Metadata section.

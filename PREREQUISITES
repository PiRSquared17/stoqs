# PREREQUISITES 
# =============

# These commands need to be executed once on your system, they have been tested on CentOS 6.
# It is assumed that Postgres 9.1 is already installed.  A production environment will most
# likely have all of these packages installed.  Check with your system administrator to be 
# sure.

su -c "easy_install virtualenv"
su -c "yum -y install rabbitmq-server gdal scipy mod_wsgi"
su -c "/sbin/chkconfig rabbitmq-server on"
su -c "/sbin/service rabbitmq-server start"
su -c "rabbitmqctl add_user stoqs stoqs"		# Note: You may want different credentials
su -c "rabbitmqctl add_vhost stoqs"				# for the Rabbitmq account - here we use 'stoqs'.
su -c 'rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p stoqs stoqs ".*" ".*" ".*"'

# Go to the directory where you have checked out the stoqs project, e.g.:

cd ~/dev/stoqshg

# Instructions below are for setting up a development environment.  If you are running 
# in a production environment then it's likely that all of these Python libraries have 
# been installed at the system level and you will not need to do the following steps.
# Proceed to the instructions in the INSTALL file.
 
# Create a venv for a development environment
virtualenv venv-stoqs
source venv-stoqs/bin/activate, (source venv-stoqs/bin/activate.csh if using csh or tcsh)

# Install additional Python packages required by STOQS:
easy_install numpy
easy_install paste
easy_install pydap
easy_install django==1.3
easy_install django-celery
easy_install coards
easy_install seawater
easy_install gdal-python
export PATH=/usr/pgsql-9.1/bin:$PATH
easy_install psycopg2==2.4.1

# When running django-admin.py or 'python manage.py' do it in your virtualenv, making
# sure you prompt looks something like "(venv-stoqs)[student@localhost stoqsproj]$ "
# Proceed to the instructions in the INSTALL file.

Spatial Temporal Oceanographic Query System (STOQS)
---------------------------------------------------

STOQS is a geospatial database web application designed for providing efficient 
acccess to in situ oceanographic data across any dimension - e.g., retrieving
a common parameter from all measuring platforms in a specific area over a 
specific span of time.  STOQS complements other data management technologies
such as NetCDF and OPeNDAP by providing an ability to index data retrieval 
across parameter and spatial dimensions in addition to the a priori indexed
coordinate dimensions in NetCDF.  It also provides a functional bridge between 
NetCDF and Geographic Information Systems technologies.

After installation, data is loaded into STOQS from a variety of data sources,
including OPeNDAP data sets, other relational databases, and flat files.  
Products are delivered in a variety of formats, including KML, via REST-style 
web requests.

This software can be checked out of Google Code thusly:

	cd ~/dev
	hg clone https://<your_google_account>@code.google.com/p/stoqs/ stoqshg

(I like to give the top level directory a different name so as not to create confusion
with the 'stoqs' subdirectory which is the Django application within the project.)

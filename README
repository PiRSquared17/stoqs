Spatial Temporal Oceanographic Query System (STOQS)
---------------------------------------------------

STOQS is a geospatial database web application designed for providing efficient 
acccess to in situ oceanographic data across any dimension - e.g., retrieving
a common parameter from all measuring platforms in a specific area over a 
specific span of time.  STOQS complements other data management technologies
such as NetCDF and OPeNDAP by providing an ability to index data retrieval 
across parameter and spatial dimensions in addition to the a priori indexed
coordinate dimensions in NetCDF.  It also provides a functional bridge between 
NetCDF and Geographic Information Systems technologies.

After installation, data is loaded into STOQS from a variety of data sources,
including OPeNDAP data sets, other relational databases, and flat files.  
Products are delivered in a variety of formats, including KML, via REST-style 
web requests.

The first thing you'll need is the source code revision control software Mercurial
which can be installed from http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Download.

STOQS is developed using the CentOS 6 Linux distrubution.  To install Mercurial on
CentOS execute "yum -install mercurial" as root.

This software can be checked out of Google Code thusly:

    cd ~/dev
    hg clone https://<your_google_account>@code.google.com/p/stoqs/ stoqshg

Note: The source checkout instructions on the Google Code site do not include the
last argument, in which case the software will be checked out into a 'stoqs' directory.
This can be confusing as there is another 'stoqs' directory in the tree.  For this
reason we check it out to a 'stoqshg' directory to indicate that it is a Mercurial
clone.

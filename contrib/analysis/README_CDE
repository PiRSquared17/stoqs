STOQS Client cde-package instructions
=====================================

All required software is included in this cde-package for performing detailed data analysis
in STOQS.  The Python script you run is executed with a wrapper script (ending in '.cde') 
that creates the environemnt for all the code and data for the script to run.

This package is meant for running inside MBARI's firewall as direct access is made to the 
STOQS PostgreSQL databases running on the internal server kraken.  

This documentation refers to $STOQSHG_DIR, which will be something like /opt/stoqshg or the
developer's home directory.  Set it with:

export STOQSHG_DIR=$(dirname `find cde-root -name privateSettings | cut -d/ -f2-`)

See file cde-root/$STOQSHG_DIR/privateSettings for details of what databases are available.  
Use the STOQS UI at http://kraken.shore.mbari.org/canon/ in concert with script execution.

For usage notes (with examples) execute:
----------------------------------------

cd cde-root/$STOQSHG_DIR/contrib/analysis
./trajectory_biplots.py.cde --help
./crossproduct_biplots.py.cde --help

Make sure that you append ".cde" after ".py" to the example commands given in the help messages.

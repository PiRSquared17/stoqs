STOQS Client cde-package instructions
=====================================

All required software is included in this cde-package for performing detailed data analysis
in STOQS.  The Python script you run is executed with a wrapper script (ending in '.cde') 
that creates the environemnt for all the code and data for the script to run.

This package is meant for running inside MBARI's firewall as direct access is made to the 
STOQS PostgreSQL databases running on the internal server kraken.  

See file cde-root/home/mccann/dev/stoqshg/privateSettings for details of what databases
are available.  Use the STOQS UI at http://kraken.shore.mbari.org/canon/ in concert with
script execution to learn parameter, platform names, etc.

For a usage note (with examples) execute:

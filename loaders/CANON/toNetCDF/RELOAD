RELOAD
======

Instructions to backout and reload data from a STOQS database. 

If source data has been reprocessed or if you need to reload data for other reasons
here are the steps to make that happen.

1. Copy new source data files to the server where the netCDF creation scripts read them,
   e.g.:

    cd /mbari/Tempbox/mccann/MartinCTD_CANON_Fall2013
    scp *.asc stoqsadm@odss.mbari.org:/data/canon/2013_Sep/Platforms/Ships/Martin/pctd
    scp *.hdr stoqsadm@odss.mbari.org:/data/canon/2013_Sep/Platforms/Ships/Martin/pctd
    scp *.btl stoqsadm@odss.mbari.org:/data/canon/2013_Sep/Platforms/Ships/Martin/pctd

2. Execute the script that creates netCDF files and copies them back to the OPeNDAP server.
   e.g.:

    cd loaders/CANON/toNetCDF/
    ./makeJMpctdNetCDF.sh
    # Make sure the processing proceeds without error.  Fix any problems and rerun.
    # Sometimes files are provided with names that don't match.

3. Remove activities associated with the netCDF files.  Launch a Python shell on a system
   with a privateSettings entry to the database you wish to modify, e.g.:

    (venv-stoqs)[mccann@localhost stoqshg]$ ./manage.py shell_plus

    acts = Activity.objects.using('stoqs_september2013_o').filter(name__contains='JMC')
    for a in acts:
        a.delete(using='stoqs_september2013_o')
   
4. Edit appropriate load script to load just the new data, e.g.:

    ...
    elif cl.args.optimal_stride:
        # Next 2 lines are temporary for addition of reprocessed JM pctd data
        cl.loadJMpctd(stride=1)
        sys.exit()
        ...

5. Execute load, e.g.:

    loaders/CANON/loadCANON_september2013.py -o


6. Remove temporary lines added to the load script


    


6. Check that all looks good in the STOQS UI

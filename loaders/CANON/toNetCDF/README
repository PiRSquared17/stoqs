This directory contains scripts to convert miscellaneous data to NetCDF so that
it can be put on an OPeNDAP server for loading by DAPloaders.py.

    ./wgToNetcdf.py /net/tornado/vol/vol0/Tracking/gliders
    <scp files created to TDS>

Then run the appropriate loadCANON_... script one directory up to load the data into STOQS.

The make__.sh scripts will copy the needed input files to this directory, run the converter 
and then copy the files to a TDS server.

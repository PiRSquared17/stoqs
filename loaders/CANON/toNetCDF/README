loaders/CANON/toNetCDF
======================

This directory contains scripts to convert miscellaneous data to NetCDF so that
it can be put on an OPeNDAP server for loading by STOQS loaders.

The __init__.py file contains a BaseWriter class that is used for consistent
writing of metadata.  The data are written using CF-1.6 conventions described at
http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/1.6/cf-conventions.html.

The shell scripts (.sh files) beginning with 'make' are modified and executed
to copy source data files from their locations, typically an ODSS server, to
the current directory where the appropriate conversion program is then executed.
The resulting .nc files are then copied by the make__.sh script back to the ODSS 
server where a TDS catalog has been configured to serve them.

Conversion scripts for trajectory featureTypes:

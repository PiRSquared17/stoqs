\section{Understanding Data}

\subsection{Labeling}
Today's oceanographic campaigns produce tens of millions of diverse measurements; this volume of data is too great for one to understand all of its information, even with an the effective user interface that STOQS provides.

The same database foundation that enables uniform data access for visualization purposes can be used for analytical purposes.

We are currently exploring ways to enhance data exploration and discovery using both supervised and unsupervised machine-learning methods.  These methods would produce tags that are stored in association tables that can be tied back to the actual data values.  In the future, we envision these tags being further refined through expert validation, or as a feature to other processing, whether it is biological models or further machine learning models.  This is a challenging exploration and we are only in the beginning phases of this work.

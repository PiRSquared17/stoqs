\section{Using STOQS}

\subsection{Operation}

STOQS has been in use at MBARI for over 3 years to help manage and visualize data collected during upper water column measurement campaigns where scientific goals center on improving our understanding of biological processes. The data consist primarily of measurements collected by moving platforms. The platforms have accurate clocks, Global Positioning Sensors and underwater inertial navigation sensors, and one or more instruments that measure parameters such as temperature, salinity, oxygen, nitrate, chlorophyll fluorescence, optical backscatter, and particle sizes. Some platforms can also capture water samples for later laboratory analysis. A typical workflow for is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Install the STOQS software on a Linux server
\item Vehicles conduct their missions, collecting data
\item Create NetCDF files of the instrument data
\item Construct and execute a STOQS load script
\item Access and visualize data using the STOQS UI
\end{enumerate}

# SERVER 
# ======

# These instructions are for setting up a CentOS 6.5 server from scratch in order to have
# everything in place for following the instructions in PREPREQUISITES.  It assumes that
# you have a computer or virtualization software (e.g. VMware, VirtualBox) and can perform
# an operating system installation from an ISO image.
#
# Download a CentOS 6.5 x86_64 image from http://www.centos.org/download/ and install it
# following the instructions provided.
#
# Configuring your disk partitions:
# ---------------------------------
# A 60 GB disk provides plenty of space to host a STOQS development environment and several
# full resolution campaign databases.  Here is how I've partitioned a 60 GB drive:

[mccann@localhost ~]$ df      -h
Filesystem                       Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/vg_livedvd-lv_root    22G  5.4G   16G  26% /
tmpfs                            497M  148K  497M   1% /dev/shm
/dev/sda1                        485M   35M  425M   8% /boot
/dev/mapper/vg_livedvd-lv_home    20G  193M   19G   2% /home
/dev/mapper/vg_livedvd-LogVol03   15G  165M   14G   2% /pgdata
/dev/mapper/vg_livedvd-LogVol04  985M   18M  918M   2% /pgtablespace
/dev/mapper/vg_livedvd-LogVol05  485M   11M  449M   3% /pgxlog

# (The /pgdata, /pgtablespace, and /pgxlog partitions will be symbolically linked in the
# installed postgresql directories.)
#
# Install RHEL EPEL repository so that yum(1) can find most everything you need to install
# (See http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories for more information):

wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
wget http://rpms.famillecollet.com/enterprise/remi-release-6.rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh remi-release-6*.rpm epel-release-6*.rpm

# Install PostgreSQL 9.3 (see http://yum.postgresql.org/howtoyum.php):
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Download appropriate .rpm file, e.g.: pgdg-centos93-9.3-1.noarch.rpm and install it:

sudo rpm -ivh /tmp/pgdg-centos93-9.3-1.noarch.rpm
sudo yum groupinstall "PostgreSQL Database Server 9.3 PGDG"





# Proceed to the instructions in the PREREQUISITES file.

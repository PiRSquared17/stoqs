CHANGELOG
=========

Significant milestones in the STOQS software project

Version 1.0: 5 January 2012

- Major refactoring completed after excising all of the old SQL Alchemy and old
  stoqs_<campaign> directories from the project.  ALLCAPS instruction files added
  and Django unit tests are operational with a sample load provided in DAPloaders.py.

- This is now a "compliant" Django application that is ready to be used for fusion,
  query, and product generation of in situ oceanograhic measurements.  More 
  importantly, the project now has a good foundation its enhancement using agile
  software development methodology.

Version 1.1: 11 April 2012

- New utils/STOQSQManager.py module which powers the ajax driven query web page
  where parameter, platform, depth and time  selection works to constrain activity 
  maptracks which are displayed in an OpenLayers Mapserver powered map.  Measurement
  data can be retrieved in KML format if the user has selected a parameter.

Version 1.2: 6 February 2013

  Sample Data
  -----------
  - loaders/SampleLoader.py has been updated with code to load sub sample data to be 
    attached as children to original parent water samples
  - The Parameters selector has been split into "Sampled Parameters" and "Measured 
    Parameters" selectors
  - All Sample data is displayed in a table under Sample Data Access when a sample
    icon is clicked in the Time-Depth plot

  User Interface
  --------------
  - Multiple parameters can now be selected and retrieved via the Measurement Data
    Access
  - The Show data values checkbox under the Time-Depth plot become active when one 
    Platform and one Parameter is selected; if checked the server will create a 
    color-filled contour plot and place it on top of the depth-time plot.
  - The Parameter Values section allows for filtering the data selection by click
    and dragging a selection on the histogram plot; multiple selections may be made.
    If Show data values is checked (under the Map plot) and a Parameter Values selection 
    is made then the data values are shown with colored dots rather than with a 
    color-filled contour plot
  - The Show sensor tracks checkbox will display the selected Measured Parameter
    data values on the map based on the Depth, Time, Platform, and Parameter Value
    selections
  - Clear Selection buttons have been added to each selection section
  - Radio buttons for X, Y, and Color have been added for each Parameter in
    preparation for adding parameter-parameter plot creation
  - Mesasurement Data access (the "Get Data" button) works for the following
    formats: KML, SQL, Matlab (via STOQSTOOLBOX), JSON, CSV, TSV, and HTML

Version 1.3: 5 September 2013

  Time Series Data
  ----------------
  - loaders/DAPoaders.py modified to also recognize and load data specified with CF-1.6 
    Discrete Sampling Geometry featureTypes of "timeSeries" and "timeSeriesProfile".  
    This is in addition to the already recognized featyreType of "trajectory".
  
  User Interface
  --------------
  - Plot functionality has been separated from Filter and Data Access functionality.
    To plot a Parameter spatially and temporally one now selects a radio button next
    to the Parameter name button.  This works for bot Sampled Parameters and
    Measured Paramters.
  - Sampled Paramter datavalue plotting now works.  If sub sample data containing
    sampledparater datavalues have been loaded then  
  User Interface

# Derived Parameters added upon data load #

Given appropriate CF-NetCDF input variable and settings in STOQS load scripts these Measured Parameters are now added upon load:

  * sigma-t
  * spice
  * altitude

# Details #

If the input dataset contains variables with standard\_name attributes of sea\_water\_temperature and sea\_water\_salinity then additional derived parameters are computed and inserted into the database. These are sigma-t (with standard name sea\_water\_sigma-t) and spice (or spiciness). The former is computed using the seawater.csiro Python library and and the latter is computed using the algorithm from http://www.satlab.hawaii.edu/spice/spice.html.

If a STOQS loader is instantiated with a keyword option of grdTerrain (assigned to a file name of a GMT bathymetry .grd file) then the GMT program grdtrack is used to get the bottom depth at the location of each measurement. This bottom depth is used to compute the altitude (with standard name height\_above\_seafloor) for each measurement, which is inserted into the database as a Measured Parameter.

All of these new derived Parameters are available for plotting and exploration via the STOQS User Interface.

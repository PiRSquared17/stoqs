Instructions for loading your data in STOQS

These instructions cover the loading of in situ discrete sampling geometry feature type 
data from OPeNDAP accessible data sources.  Data adhereing to the Climate and Forecast
conventions version 1.6 are supported for loading into STOQS.  Specific feature types
supported are: trajectory, timeSeries, and timeSeriesProfile.  For more information
please see:

        http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/documents/cf-conventions/1.6/cf-conventions.html
        http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/data/formats/netcdf/

There are many ways to write data adhering to these standards - there are some examples
using the Python pupynere library here in the loaders/CANON/toNetCDF directory.

Here are the step-by-step instuctions for getting your data into STOQS given the above
prerequisites:

1. Add a new file to the loaders directory named to describe the campaign that is 
   the source of the data.  The campaign name may be a project name or a month_year
   combination.  It can really be anything you want.  At MBARI for the CANON project
   we typically have field programs where intensive measurements are collected in
   an area of the ocean over a several week period, so we name our campaigns like
   'sept2010' and our stoqs databases like 'stoqs_sept2010' and 'stoqs_june2011'.
   The point of using separate databases for campaigns is to constrain the size
   of the databases, which helps in managing them and in evolving stoqs applications
   while maintaining some level of consistent functionality of access for databases
   that are not under development.
   
2. In your new loadXXXX.py file instantiate a DAPloaders object with accurate attributes
   for each activity to be loaded.  There are several examples of other load files in
   the loaders/ directory.  Feel free to use them as a basis for the data you wish to load.

3. The CANON directory in loaders/ contains load scripts for all of the MBARI CANON
   campaigns.  Much of the commonly used loader code has been factored out into a 
   CANONLoader class in loaders/CANON/__init__.py so that the load scripts (e.g. 
   loadCANON_september2012.py) simply need to be constructed with the OPeNDAP URLs
   and parameter names for each type of platform.

4. Create a PostgreSQL database for your campaign (full instructions are in the 
   INSTALL file).  At the psql prompt:

     create database stoqs_september2012_s100 owner=stoqsadm template=template_postgis;
     \c stoqs_september2012_s100
     grant all on all tables in schema public to stoqsadm;
     alter database stoqs_september2012_s100 set timezone='GMT'

   The convention is to append the append the stride value ('_s100') to the campaign
   portion of the database name.

5. Add the new database to your privateSettings file (see INSTALL):

     'stoqs_september2012_s100': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis',
        'NAME': 'stoqs_september2012_s100',
        'USER': DATABASE_USER,
        'PASSWORD': DATABASE_PASSWORD,
        'HOST': DATABASE_HOST,
        'PORT': DATABASE_PORT
     },

6. Restart your server to force a re-read of the settings file.  On a development server
   simply restart "python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000" which you normally have running
   in its own shell window (see DEVELOPMENT).  On a production server restart apache with
   "sudo /sbin/service httpd restart" (see PRODUCTION). 

7. Synchronize the new database with the stoqs data model.  At a shell prompt in your virtual
   environment (see PREREQUISITES and INSTALL):

     source venv-stoqs/bin/activate
     ./manage.py syncdb --database=stoqs_september2012_s100

8. Execute your load script.  If following the example of the scripts in loaders/CANON they
   take two arguments (<stride> <db_name>).  For example to populate the example database:

     loaders/CANON/loadCANONseptember2012.py 100 stoqs_september2012_s100

   To populated a full-resolution database repeat steps 4-7 with another database name,
   say "stoqs_september2012" and execute:

     loaders/CANON/loadCANONseptember2012.py 1 stoqs_september2012

9. Notes:

    - As a campaign produces data files those files may be added to the script.  To add
      data to an existing database simply comment out previously loaded files and re-execute
      the script (step 8) with the new files.
    - some programs to create NetCDF files from various original data files (e.g. Seabird underway 
      and profile CTD) are in the loaders/CANON/toNetCDF directory.  See the README
      there for instructions on running those scripts to put the data on an OPeNDAP server
      so that your STOQS loader can load them.
    - Editing and running the load script during a campaign is an interactive process requiring
      interaction with people and testing the data sources for valid parameter names as well
      as monitoring the script's output for warning and error messages.
    - The stoqs-discuss mail list (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/stoqs-discuss)
      is a good place to ask questions if any problems are encountered.
